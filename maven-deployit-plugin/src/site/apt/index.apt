Deployit Plugin

  The Deployit Plugin is used to deploy a Deployment Package to an single environment containing at least an Application Server.
  
  Definition: Deployment is the 'series of activities needed to make an application available to end users'. This includes the full scope of deployment activities: de-installation of the old software packages, installation of the new software packages, updating the data source(s), modifying firewall settings, reconfiguring the web server and restarting all services involved. Or rephrased in more simple terms: deployment is everything needed to ensure that if a developer, tester or end user opens his browser and types in www.my-application.com, he will see the application up and running, fully functional with (live) data.

  This plugin is in particular handy to perform integration tests for other Maven plugins.

* Goals Overview

  The plugin has three goals meant to participate in the default build lifecycle:

  * {{{generate-deployment-package-mojo.html}deployit:generate-deployment-package}} Generate a Deployment Package.

  * {{{deploy-mojo.html}deployit:deploy}} Deploy the main artifact, middleware resources to a single environment.

  * {{{clean-mojo.html}deployit:clean}} Undeploy all what is have been deployed in the  {{{deploy-mojo.html}deployit:deploy}} goal.

  entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated.
  Of course, patches are welcome, too. Contributors can check out the project from our
  {{{./source-repository.html}source repository}} and will find supplementary information in the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-helping.html}guide to helping with Maven}}.

* Examples

  The following example configurations are available to illustrate selected use cases in more detail:

  * {{{examples/simple-deployment.html}Simple deployment}} to a Tomcat Server.

  * {{{examples/generate-dar.html}Generate DAR}}, the Deployit Archive.

  * {{{examples/simple-deployment-and-clean.html}Simple deployment and Clean}} to a Tomcat Server and clean after the integration-test phase.

  * {{{examples/examples/add-additional-artifacts.html}Adding additional Maven artifacts}}

  * {{{examples/middleware-resources.html}Define middleware resources }} such as Datasources or JMS Queues.

  * {{{examples/test-configuration.html}Testing the configurationn}} to test the plugin configuration by skipping the executions of the deployment's steps.

  * {{{examples/configuration-files.html}Add configurationn file }} to the current deployment.

  * {{{examples/functional-tests.html} Deploy and Run functional tests }}
